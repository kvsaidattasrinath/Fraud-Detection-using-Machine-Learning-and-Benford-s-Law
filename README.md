# Fraud-Detection-using-Machine-Learning-and-Benford-s-Law
Exploring fraud patterns in financial transaction data using Random Forest and Benford’s Law, focusing on behavioral and numerical analysis.

This project investigates financial fraud detection by integrating machine learning with statistical digit analysis. A Random Forest model is used to identify behaviorally suspicious transactions, after which Benford’s Law is applied to evaluate numerical irregularities within the flagged subset. The results demonstrate that Benford’s Law is most effective as a secondary validation tool when combined with machine learning.
